# GMN
This study aimed to propose a mutation-based signature to predict ICB efficacy in both non-mutant and oncogene-mutant NSCLC patients for clinical practice. Four public and one in-house immunotherapy cohorts were utilized for construction and validation. As a result, we revealed the following findings: 
1) The signature divided patients into two subgroups (GMN-H vs. GMN-L). The GMN-H was associated with significant overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced NSCLCs after ICB therapy.
2) The survival advantage in the GMN-H group remained in the KRAS-mutant patients. In contrast, only trends of improved survival outcomes were observed in the GMN-H group in ICB-treated patients with EGFR, HER2, or MET alterations.
3) Moreover, in KRASG12C- or KRASG12V-mutant subgroups, the GMN-H patients also preserved better OS.
4) Compared with the GMN-L patients, the GMN-H patients were associated with higher neoantigens, enriched WNT and MAPK pathways, and increased intra-tumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells.
